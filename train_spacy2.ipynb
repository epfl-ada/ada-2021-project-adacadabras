      "The people who publicly talk about sex and sexuality are super-predominantly women. The way that men have been programmed how to talk about sex, is by bragging and objectifying women. The idea that sexual sensitivity is emasculating is so sad. It's tragic for men and it's tragic for women and that's not healthy for a romantic or sexual relationship. Spoiler alert: men are actually sexually repressed too and women need to start accepting that. There is a faction of the feminist movement that's man-hating and I find that off-putting.\n",

      "Feminists have long argued that traditional gender roles harm women... It's also possible, though, that received expectations of men hurt men,\n",
      "Many in the audience laughed when I said it, but I had at least two women who were present at the event openly acknowledge that they felt this was an idea that needed to be explored. I realize that many women like to keep the activities of their sex lives discreet and private, but the reality is, a good number of men have been falsely accused of date-rape and sexual misconduct by women who suffered nothing more than `sex regret' and `next-day guilt.' Just like no woman wants a reputation as a `promiscuous slut,' no man wants to be falsely accused of being a rapist,\n",

Over the course of the divorce, Biden's son drained hundreds of thousands of dollars from the couple's assets by spending extravagantly on his own interests, including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he had sexual relations while leaving the family with no money to pay legitimate bills.\n",

      "I told R Kelly dumb ass he should've just left the country\n",
      "In one of our first calls, I ran to answer the phone and he said: `There's my vagina' . His nickname would be vagina or he'd say: `There's my pussy' . I laid down the marker and said it is not going to happen, that's not how you are going to refer to me, but that's where he wanted to take the conversation-down a sexual route.\n",
      "But we hear lyrics in music all the time that are about fucking women and bitches and all this stuff that's disempowering for the woman and very much objectifying her. So I'm here writing music about fucking, and it's in a much more unifying and sexy way. But I think people are just gon na be shocked because it's coming from me, who is an unexpected source of that.\n",
      "We knew there might be some fear reluctance over the subject matter, but assumed those would be related to ideas of either promoting drugs or the typical `bitches and bongs' misogyny and cliches,\n",

      "And suddenly, it was like my dress was being torn off of me, my underwear was being torn off of me, people were putting their fingers inside of me and grabbing my breasts really hard, screaming things in my ears like `pussy-whore-cunt.' When I got back onstage I was naked. I felt like Karen Finley. But the worst thing of all was that I saw a photograph of it later. Someone took a picture of me right when this was happening, and I had this big smile on my face like I was pretending it wasn't happening... I can't compare it to rape because it's not the same. But in a way it was. I was raped by an audience, figuratively, literally, and yet, was I asking for it?\n",
