# MeToo, a catalyst for change?
___Study of the influence of the movement on women's mediatic representation___
## Abstract
“#MeToo". Two words, a hashtag, a civil rights movement with tremendous impacts on our society. Everything starts, on October 15th, 2017, with a viral hashtag on Twitter, posted by Alyssa Milano. The movement, initially created by Tarana Burke, spread all over the world, inviting women and minorities to break the silence on sexual harassment, violence, and discrimination via social networks. The medias stepped in with a widespread coverage and enhanced the movement influence. Finally, women inequalities and the unsafe climate the society offers them, became a trending and polarized topic on all medias. Still, the question of impact size of MeToo on women's importance and discrimination is to be answered. Via the metric of women's mediatic coverage, our project aims at assessing and quantifying the impact of #MeToo on the way women are given a place in our society. By using Quotebank dataset from 2015 to 2020, we will investigate the evolution of women’s mediatization through time and correlate it to #MeToo key turning points.

## Research questions
* How has the mediatization of women been tuned by the emergence of the MeToo movement?
    * A) What is the evolution of the general mediatic perspective of MeToo movement ? Are there any gender, political or generational biases observable in the mediatic coverage of the movement ? 
    * B) Linguistic analysis of women's mediatic representation: How did the terms and tones used by the speakers in medias (when speaking of women) change through time ? How does the themes discussed evolve ? 
    * C) Is the evolution of women's mediatization (addressed in sub-question B) correlated to the tendency of MeToo's mediatic perspective?
